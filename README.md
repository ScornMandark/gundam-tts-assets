# gundam-tts-assets
A variety of asset bundles for Tabletop Simulator

Haro.json is a TTS saved object, just copy it to your saved object folder and load it into your game!
Haro pulls the latest version of the unit code directly from the repository, overwriting itself, so every time you load it up it'll have the latest set of repository information.

Current feature list:
Set Scale - defaults to 1/144 scale in game, but you can set it to whatever you want.
Set Game - affects how the unit cards are loaded and a few other things.
Create - begins the navigation tree for grabbing a unit!  Lots of units already, more to come.
