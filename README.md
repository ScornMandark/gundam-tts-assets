A variety of asset bundles for Tabletop Simulator

To get the Loader into your game, just [subscribe to the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2450780114), then Additively Load it to your game.  It's that easy!

Haro pulls the latest version of the unit code directly from the repository, overwriting itself, so every time you load it up it'll have the latest set of repository information.

NOTE: If you're experiencing issues, try Reinitialize from the settings menu.  Sometimes your cached version doesn't match the existing one.

If the unit you selected isn't pulling up a unit card, make sure the card exists.  If it doesn't, contact the game devs :) 

Current feature list:
* Set Scale - defaults to 1/144 scale in game, but you can set it to whatever you want.
* Set Game - affects how the unit cards are loaded and a few other things.
* Base and Base Size - whether or not there's a base, and how big the base is.
* Create - begins the navigation tree for grabbing a unit!  Lots of units already, more to come.

If you'd like to contribute, I'd love that!  I'm putting some resources together to help people get the models set up.
